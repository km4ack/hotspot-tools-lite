# Tools in Script

1 - Change SSID name and/or password for the hotspot 

2 - Run hotspot script to check for known SSID’s in range

3 - Disable the hotspot. This will make it like the hotspot feature doesn’t exist on the pi. This is something that quite a few people have asked for.

4 - Enable hotspot that has been disabled using #3

5 - Change the IP of hotspot & pi DHCP server (Experimental)

6 - Manage SSID's. Add/Remove SSID's from the system. Helpful when in hotspot mode and no previously known SSID’s are in range.

7 - List Known SSID’s already in the pi.

8 - Update the hotspot tools app
